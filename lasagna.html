    <h2>Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        Onion and</p>
    <p>garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>
    <p>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>
    <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>
    <p> and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
    <p>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
    <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
    <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
